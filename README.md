# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As a student in video game programming, I am looking for my first job as a video game programmer, having more experience with gameplay and UI programming specifically. Below are listed all of my projects, from my most recent one to the least recent one.

# About me
Programming languages: **C#, C++**  
Most significant contribution: **SteamBound project**  
Relevant courses completed: **Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Object-Oriented Programming, Game Engine 1&2 (Unity and Unreal)**  
My itch profile: https://ksoucha.itch.io

# My projects
## LazerBot
_Made with Unreal Engine in Blueprint_

**Description:** A laser-based puzzle game where you play as a robot navigating through multiple levels by redirecting laser beams and manipulating objects
* Developed laser mechanics with interactive elements: beams can be blocked, reflected, or redirected by different objects
* Designed level layouts to support smooth gameplay flow
* Implemented a scoring system (in-game UI widget) to track the number of lasers successfully redirected into color-changing cones
* Built UI widgets for the main menu, instructions, pause, and end-game screens, enhancing the user experience
* Itch.io page: [LazerBot](https://ksoucha.itch.io/lazerbot)

## [SteamBound](https://github.com/Ksoucha/ProjectGameOff2024) - submission for the GameOff2024 game jam
_Made with Unreal Engine in Blueprint and C++_

**Description:** An action-adventure game where the player can fight enemies using different combinations of magic attributes (element, shape, size, speed). It is also possible to switch between first-person and top-down mode, the latter allowing the player to strategically control allies to defeat the enemies.
* Implemented the UI widgets for the main menu, the game-over screen and the end-game screen
* Implemented civilian AI behavior using Behavior Trees, enabling dynamic alert-level changes
* Developed a data-oriented system for interactable books using data tables and enum-driven IDs, allowing narrative and level designers to dynamically update content without code changes
* Optimized the Music Manager blueprint by replacing inefficient per-frame agent checks with collision-based triggers and implementing a map structure (instead of multiple booleans) for music selection
* Itch.io page: [SteamBound](https://doumeki21.itch.io/steambound)

## [LinkedListVisualizer](https://github.com/Ksoucha/LinkedListVisualizerProject)
_Made with OpenFrameworks in C++_

**Objective**: simulate how a linked list works by changing its properties dynamically
* Implemented a random number generator to use for the values of the linked list
* Implemented a linked list represented by circles with the numbers inside
* Implemented an oscillating animation for the circles

## [SortingProject](https://github.com/Ksoucha/SortingProject)
_Made with OpenFrameworks in C++_

**Objective**: make a visual representation of 4 sorting algorithms that can be generated and regenerated during runtime
* Implemented a random number generator to create a list of numbers
* Implemented 4 different sorting algorithms represented by circles with the numbers inside
* Implemented the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm

## [Santa Elves](https://github.com/Ksoucha/SantaElves)
_Made with Unity in 3D_

**Description:** A first-person Christmas narrative game where you play as an elf on a mission to finish the final toy needed for Santa's present delivery
* Worked on the story progression (talk to NPCs, find objects and give them to the right person)
* Contributed to the set-up of the dialogue system
  * Dynamic dialogue that changes depending on the actions completed
  * In-level UI text that appears only when interacting with a character (by pressing **E**)
* Implemented a puzzle involving scattered stones and numbers that are used to solve numpad codes
* Implemented a particle system for the light effect of the Christmas tree
* Worked on the level design

## The Bookworm - submission for the ScreamJam2024
_Made with Unity in 3D_

**Description:** Horror game where the player goes through a maze and tries to find an exit without getting spotted by the monster
* Implemented an AI patrolling above the maze and "eating" the floor and wall tiles that he passes by
* Worked on the UI for the main menu, the end game screen and the narrative text
* Itch.io page: [The Bookworm](https://ksoucha.itch.io/the-bookworm)

## [BoucleBleue](https://github.com/Ksoucha/BoucleBleue)
_My first narrative text-based game, made in Console Application in C#_

**Description:** Horror narrative game where players interact by choosing objects to inspect, rooms to explore, or actions to perform by typing one of the options shown in square brackets
* Implemented a dependency-based progression system where specific actions unlock new possibilities and change the game atmosphere
* Implemented interconnected rooms with descriptions that evolve as the story goes on
* Implemented multiple endings, unlocked based on the playerâ€™s choices

## Other projects
* [EnigmAlchemy](https://github.com/Ksoucha/Enigmalchemy_Fork)
* [FruityBird](https://github.com/Ksoucha/TP1_FruityBird)
* [GravityMan](https://github.com/Ksoucha/TP2_GravityMan)
