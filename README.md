* Implemented a particle system
* Worked on the level design

## [SortingProject](https://github.com/Ksoucha/SortingProject)
_Made with OpenFrameworks in C++_  
**Objective**: make a visual representation of 4 sorting algorithms that can be generated and regenerated dynamically
* Implemented a random number generator to create a list of numbers
* Implemented 4 different sorting algorithms represented by circles
* Implemented the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm

## [LinkedListVisualizer](https://github.com/Ksoucha/LinkedListVisualizerProject)
_Made with OpenFrameworks in C++_  
**Objective**: simulate how a linked list works by changing its properties dynamically
* Implemented a linked list represented by circles
* Implemented a random number generator to use for the values of the linked list
* Implemented an animation for the circles

## [SteamBound](https://github.com/Ksoucha/ProjectGameOff2024) - submission for the GameOff2024 game jam
_Made with Unreal Engine in Blueprint and C++_
* Implemented the UI widgets and their logic in Blueprint
* Worked on the civilian AI logic with Behavior Trees
* Focused on a data-oriented structure by using data tables with game endings
* Modified some Blueprints to optimize the code structure by adding relavant data structures and algorithms
* Itch.io page: [SteamBound](https://doumeki21.itch.io/steambound)

## LazerBot
_Made with Unreal Engine in Blueprint_
* Worked on lasers mechanics - lasers that get blocked or reflected by different objects
* Implemented cubes that can reflect lasers at a 90-degree angle
* Worked on the level design
* Worked on the gameplay logic
* Itch.io page: [LazerBot](https://ksoucha.itch.io/lazerbot)
